title: OpenAustralia development of website and parser
---
Welcome to the development site for "openaustralia.org":http://www.openaustralia.org/. This is your kicking off point for all things to do with the development of "openaustralia.org":http://www.openaustralia.org/, including the reporting and browsing of bugs and development ideas, documentation on installing and configuring the software for yourself and a guide to contributing to the codebase.

The Open Australia software consists of two main components, the web application which is based on code from the UK site "theyworkforyou.com":http://theyworkforyou.com and a web scraper / parser which was written from scratch for downloading and parsing the Hansard data from the "Australian Parliament website":http://www.aph.gov.au.

All of the software is *free* and *open source*.

The web application code is licensed under a "BSD type license":https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=mysociety/twfy/LICENSE.txt&v=1.1. The web scraper / parser is licensed under the "GNU Affero General Public License":http://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser/tree/master%2FLICENSE.txt?raw=true.
